# Taskurotta workflow builder

Author Taskurotta workflows as Radish source. A registered workflow lives at
`<project>/.taskurotta/<workflow-id>/workflow.rad`. Do not create or edit workflow TOML.

If the assistant prompt provides an exact Taskurotta CLI path, use it instead of bare
`gof`. Run `gof radish docs --format json` to locate the installed Radish specification
and machine-readable node contracts. This command works in desktop and wheel installs and
does not require a Taskurotta source checkout.

## Authoring workflow

1. Inspect registered workflows with `gof radish list --format json`.
2. For a new workflow, run:

   ```bash
   gof radish create "Workflow name" --project <project-folder> --format json
   ```

   Read `workflow.sourcePath` from the JSON response. Edit that `workflow.rad` file.
3. For an existing workflow, edit the `sourcePath` supplied in the assistant's workflow
   context or returned by `gof radish list --format json`.
4. Consult only the documentation needed for the change:
   - `README.md` for the language overview and CLI.
   - `grammar.ebnf` and `lexical-spec.md` for source spelling.
   - `static-semantics.md` for bindings, routes, inputs, and path rules.
   - `node-contracts.md` for shared execution fields and node behavior.
   - The installed `contracts/` directory for the exact fields, defaults, and schemas of
     each node type. Machine contracts and compiler diagnostics override prose examples.
5. Validate every edit:

   ```bash
   gof radish format <workflow.rad>
   gof radish check <workflow.rad> --format json
   gof radish preflight <workflow.rad> --format json
   ```

   Fix error diagnostics and re-run the failed command. Report warnings instead of hiding
   them. Do not run the workflow unless the user authorizes real execution.

## Radish essentials

A minimal workflow is:

```radish
Radish: 1

Workflow:
  name: Daily review

Node collect:
  type: bash-command
  command: git status --short
  to: review

Node review:
  type: agent
  provider: codex
  prompt: Review the repository status.
  needs: collect
```

Use kebab-case node IDs and field names. `needs` declares readiness. `to` declares routes.
Use `with` for typed input bindings, such as `report: node.collect.output.stdout`. Workflow
inputs use `input.<name>`. Paths in Radish are project-relative and cannot escape the
project root.

Use a `loop` node for iteration or fan-out. Agent nodes do not own fan-out. Use
`allow-fail: true` plus a conditional route when an operation failure should be handled by
the graph. Set explicit workflow or node limits for intentional cycles.

Provider profiles and secrets are global Taskurotta configuration. Reference them from
Radish, but never write resolved credentials into `workflow.rad`, prompts, logs, or
generated files.

## Boundaries

- Preserve the user's project and requested trigger behavior.
- Reuse project scripts and prompts when suitable.
- Do not edit compiled JSON IR. The compiler owns IR and stores it internally.
- Do not use `gof workflow create`, `gof workflow add-node`, or other legacy TOML mutation
  commands for Radish workflows.
- If the user requests a trigger or feature that Radish 1 does not support, report that
  limitation. Do not create a legacy TOML workflow as a workaround unless the user asks.
- If the CLI or filesystem is unavailable, provide a Radish patch and say which validation
  commands could not run.
