# Radish 1 built-in node contracts

## Status

The built-in type set in this document is accepted. It preserves the capabilities of the
current runtime except its `start`, `pass`, `fail`, and `subflow` operation records. Radish
expresses the first three concepts through `start` and `finish` properties. Legacy
`subflow` and `workflow` calls both lower to the single Radish `workflow` node.

The field tables are a compatibility baseline, not yet the final machine-readable
contracts. They record current capability using Radish kebab-case names. Fields labeled
"translation" replace TOML-era structure and need conformance examples before their
contracts freeze.

## Built-in type names

Radish 1 currently names these 22 built-in node types:

```text
agent                 approval-gate         bash-command
break                 common-llm-task       copy-file
delete-file           file                  folder
http-request          local-search          local-vectorize
loop                  move-file             notification
open-resource         prompt-file           python-script
read-file             shell-script          workflow
write-file
```

All type names compare case-insensitively and lower to the spelling shown above.

Configuration schemas may mark a String property with `x-radish-role: provider_id` or
`x-radish-role: identifier`. The compiler lowercases values only for those identifier roles.
Opaque strings such as model names, prompts, paths, URLs, commands, and JSON values remain
case-sensitive. A closed String enum may use `x-radish-case-insensitive: true` when its values
are language-like identifiers rather than preserved data.

## Common node fields

Every node contract includes these execution fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Rule |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `type` | identifier | required | Selects one built-in or qualified plugin contract. |
| `needs` | node ID or list | `[]` | One-time readiness requirements. |
| `to` | route or list | none | Outgoing routes after success or allowed failure. |
| `with` | local binding map | `{}` | Typed locals, resolved and snapshotted at node start; same-named input ports also receive them. |
| `start` | Boolean | `false` | Optional assertion and styling hint. |
| `finish` | `pass`, `fail`, or `none` | `none` | Optional terminal outcome and styling hint. |
| `allow-fail` | Boolean | `false` | Allows operation failure to route without failing the workflow. |
| `timeout` | duration or `none` | `none` | Limits active processing time for one execution. |
| `max-runs` | positive integer or `none` | `none` | Fails before an execution would exceed the limit. |
| `max-concurrency` | positive integer | `1` | Limits overlapping executions of this node. |
| `retry-count` | nonnegative integer | `0` | Adds operation attempts inside one routed node run. |
| `retry-delay` | duration | `1s` | Delay between attempts; counts toward workflow timeout only. |

`finish: pass` and `finish: fail` prohibit `to`. `finish: fail` also prohibits
`allow-fail: true`. `start: true` prohibits `needs`.

The old common fields map as follows:

| Current field | Radish treatment |
|---|---|
| `allow_failure` | Renamed `allow-fail`. |
| `timeout_seconds` | Replaced by the duration-valued `timeout`. |
| `inputs` | Replaced by `with`. |
| `pipe_output` | Replaced by an explicit `with` binding. |
| `await_all_inputs` | Replaced by `needs` plus the readiness rules. |
| `on_failure` | Replaced by `allow-fail` and conditional `to` routes. |
| `label` | Editor presentation belongs in `workflow.metadata.json`. |
| `for_each` | Requires a Radish loop and binding translation before freezing. |
| `fail_fast` | Belongs to the loop or fan-out contract, not every node. |

## Script and command nodes

| Type | Required fields | Optional fields and defaults |
|---|---|---|
| `bash-command` | `command: String` | `working-dir: Path = none`, `env: StringMap = {}` |
| `python-script` | `script-path: Path` | `args: StringList = []`, `env: StringMap = {}` |
| `shell-script` | `script-path: Path` | `args: StringList = []`, `env: StringMap = {}` |

For all three command and script types, `with.stdin` supplies standard input. Every other
`with` name becomes an environment variable by replacing hyphens with underscores and
converting ASCII letters to uppercase while remaining available as a local. For example,
`build-mode` becomes `BUILD_MODE` and can also appear as `{{build-mode}}` in configuration.
String values are passed unchanged. Structured values use canonical compact JSON.

`python-script.args` and `shell-script.args` are ordered authored arguments. Bindings do
not append implicit positional arguments.

The runtime constructs the command environment in this order, with later sources taking
precedence:

1. inherited process environment;
2. the node's `env` map;
3. environment variables generated from `with` bindings.

An existing variable is therefore replaced for that node execution. Its presence in the
runtime environment never affects compilation.

```radish
Node test:
  type: bash-command
  command: run-tests
  env:
    "BUILD_MODE": local
  with:
    build-mode: input.mode
```

Here `input.mode` supplies `BUILD_MODE` for this execution. It replaces both the authored
`env.BUILD_MODE` value and any inherited process value.

Both script nodes return a closed successful output object with `stdout`, `stderr`,
`exit_code`, and the resolved `script_path`. Python scripts use `python` from `PATH`.
Shell scripts use `bash`. Deployment preflight requires the selected interpreter and a
readable script file. Missing deployment resources do not invalidate compiled IR.

## File and resource nodes

| Type | Required fields | Optional fields and defaults |
|---|---|---|
| `read-file` | `path: Path` | `encoding: String = "utf-8"`, `errors: String = "strict"` |
| `write-file` | `path: Path` | `content: String = ""`, `encoding: String = "utf-8"`, `create-dirs: Boolean = true`, `overwrite: Boolean = true`, `append: Boolean = false` |
| `copy-file` | `source-path: Path`, `destination-path: Path` | `create-dirs: Boolean = true`, `overwrite: Boolean = false` |
| `move-file` | `source-path: Path`, `destination-path: Path` | `create-dirs: Boolean = true`, `overwrite: Boolean = false` |
| `delete-file` | `path: Path` | `use-trash: Boolean = true`, `recursive: Boolean = false`, `missing-ok: Boolean = false` |
| `file` | `path: Path` | none |
| `folder` | `path: Path` | none |
| `open-resource` | `target: String` | `resource-type: auto \| file \| folder \| url \| app = auto`, `args: StringList = []` |
| `prompt-file` | `output-path: Path` | `template: String = ""`, `template-path: Path = none`, `variables: StringMap = {}`, `encoding: String = "utf-8"`, `create-dirs: Boolean = true`, `overwrite: Boolean = true` |

`prompt-file.template` and `prompt-file.template-path` are mutually exclusive when both are
nonempty. Supplying both is a compile error. Named `with` bindings replace same-named
entries from `variables` for that execution.

`read-file` returns file content and resolved path metadata. `file` and `folder` return
resolved metadata without reading file content. `prompt-file` returns the rendered prompt,
the resolved output path, and the interpolation inputs. `open-resource` returns the resolved
target and concrete resource type after `auto` detection.

`read-file` output is a closed object with required `content`, `path`, `file_name`, `file_stem`,
`file_extension`, and `directory` String fields. `path` and `directory` are resolved
runtime paths; the remaining name fields are derived from that path. Deployment
preflight verifies that the file is readable and that the selected encoding and error
mode are supported. Resource availability does not affect compilation.

All filesystem paths are relative to the project root and may not be absolute, contain
an upward `..` traversal, or escape through an intermediate symlink. `copy-file`,
`move-file`, and `delete-file` support files, directories, and symlink objects. They do not
follow the final symlink. `write-file` refuses to write through a symlink. Non-append writes
replace atomically; append mode creates a missing file or appends to an existing file and
does not consult `overwrite`. When present, `with.stdin` replaces authored `content` for
that execution.

## Agent nodes

The `agent` node absorbs the current `AgentConfig` and `AgentOperation` records. Radish has
no separate agent declaration and no `agent-id` field.

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `provider` | provider identifier | required |
| `profile` | profile identifier or `none` | `none` |
| `model` | String | provider default |
| `effort` | String | provider default |
| `working-dir` | Path | `.` |
| `prompt` | String | `""` |
| `prompt-path` | Path or `none` | `none` |
| `skill` | String or `none` | `none` |
| `memory` | `none`, `run`, or `all` | `none` |
| `tools` | StringList | `[]` |
| `mcp-servers` | StringList | `[]` |
| `env` | StringMap | `{}` |
| `extra-paths` | PathList | `[]` |
| `output-schema` | JSON object or `none` | `none` |
| `output-schema-path` | Path or `none` | `none` |
| `repair-attempts` | integer from 0 through 3 | `0` |

`prompt` and `prompt-path` are mutually exclusive. Supplying both is a compile error.
Supplying neither lowers to `prompt: ""` and produces a warning only.
`output-schema` and `output-schema-path` are mutually exclusive.

The compiler resolves omitted `model` and `effort` values from the selected provider's
versioned contract and writes the resolved values into IR. Provider installation and
credentials remain deployment-preflight concerns.

`profile` selects deployment-only environment and secret configuration. It does not
select or override `provider`, `model`, or `effort`. A profile need not exist on the
compiling machine. Preflight checks that it exists and is compatible with the selected
provider.

Plaintext values are legal in `env` and other credential-shaped String fields. The
compiler emits a warning when a field name or value pattern looks sensitive. Secret
references remain the recommended form, but suspected plaintext never becomes a language
error.

The current `dynamic-count` and `fan-source` Agent fields do not enter Radish. Authors use
a `loop` node. The current numeric Agent timeout folds into the common duration-valued
`timeout` field.

`common-llm-task` keeps the current tasks `review`, `summarize`, `explain`, `extract`,
`rewrite`, and `classify`. It also absorbs its agent provider configuration instead of
using `agent-id`.

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `task` | task identifier | `summarize` |
| `target` | String | `""` |
| `instructions` | String | `""` |
| `provider` | provider identifier | required |
| `profile` | profile identifier or `none` | `none` |
| `model`, `effort` | Agent provider fields | provider defaults |
| `working-dir` | Path | `.` |
| `memory` | `none`, `run`, or `all` | `none` |
| `output-schema` | JSON object or `none` | `none` |
| `output-schema-path` | Path or `none` | `none` |
| `repair-attempts` | integer from 0 through 3 | `0` |

The common `with` block replaces the current `input-mapping` field.

## Loops and branch control

`loop` requires a `source` map. Its `source.type` selects one of these contracts:

| Source type | Required fields | Optional fields and defaults |
|---|---|---|
| `count` | none | `count: Integer = 1`, `max-concurrency: Integer = 1`, `fail-fast: Boolean = false` |
| `tabular` | `path: Path` | `max-concurrency: Integer = 1`, `fail-fast: Boolean = false` |
| `directory` | `path: Path` | `glob: String = "*"`, `include-content: Boolean = false`, `max-concurrency: Integer = 1`, `fail-fast: Boolean = false` |
| `trigger-events` | none | `include-content: Boolean = false`, `max-concurrency: Integer = 1`, `fail-fast: Boolean = false` |
| `infinite` | none | `max-concurrency: Integer = 1`, `fail-fast: Boolean = false` |

The `break` node requires `loop: NodeID` and has `message: String = ""`. It cannot have
`to`. The target must name a loop whose activation lineage can reach the Break node.

When Break completes, it succeeds and closes only the named loop activation lineage. The
executor discards iterations and loop-owned activations that have not started. Executions
already running finish their current branches. The loop's completion routes wait for those
branches to settle. Repeated Break executions for the same loop lineage are idempotent.

Radish 1 does not provide an option to cancel running iterations.

## Local retrieval nodes

| Type | Required fields | Optional fields and defaults |
|---|---|---|
| `local-vectorize` | `source-path: Path`, `index-path: Path` | `glob: String = "**/*"`, `recursive: Boolean = true`, `chunk-size: Integer = 1200`, `chunk-overlap: Integer = 120`, `encoding: String = "utf-8"`, `mode: incremental \| full \| validate = incremental`, `embedding-strategy: String = "hash_token_v1"`, `search-strategy: String = "cosine_v1"` |
| `local-search` | `index-path: Path`, `query: String` | `top-k: Integer = 5`, `score-threshold: Number = 0.0`, `include-snippets: Boolean = true`, `include-file-metadata: Boolean = true`, `embedding-strategy: String = "hash_token_v1"`, `search-strategy: String = "cosine_v1"` |

The current runtime spells the default search strategy `cosine_v1`. Strategy names are
opaque strings, so Radish preserves this spelling. The compiler normalizes only values
whose field contract declares a case-insensitive closed enum.

## HTTP and interaction nodes

`http-request` has these operation fields:

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `method` | String | `"GET"` |
| `url` | String | required |
| `headers` | StringMap | `{}` |
| `params` | StringMap | `{}` |
| `json` | JSON value or `none` | `none` |
| `body` | String or `none` | `none` |
| `request-timeout` | duration | `30s` |
| `retry` | HTTP retry map | attempts `1`, backoff `0s`, no retry statuses |
| `expected-statuses` | IntegerList | `[200]` |
| `response-mode` | `auto`, `json`, `text`, or `none` | `auto` |
| `output-mapping` | StringMap | `{}` |
| `secret-fields` | StringList | `[]` |
| `network-allowlist` | StringList | `[]` |

`request-timeout` is distinct from the common node `timeout`. It limits one HTTP attempt.
The `with` block may replace `url`, `headers`, `params`, `json`, or `body` for one node
execution. A bound `json` value suppresses authored `body`, and a bound `body` suppresses
authored `json`. Binding both is a runtime configuration error. `json` and `body` are also
mutually exclusive when both are authored.

`approval-gate` has these operation fields:

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `message` | String | required |
| `decision-timeout` | duration or `none` | `none` |
| `timeout-decision` | `reject` or `timeout` | `timeout` |
| `approvers` | StringList | `[]` |
| `notify` | Boolean | `false` |
| `notification-title` | String | `"Taskurotta approval needed"` |
| `subject` | String or `none` | `none` |

`notification` preserves the current channels `desktop`, `slack`, `teams`, `webhook`, and
`email`:

| Field | Type | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `title` | String | `"Taskurotta notification"` |
| `body` | String | `""` |
| `channel` | `desktop`, `slack`, `teams`, `webhook`, or `email` | `desktop` |
| `urgency` | `low`, `normal`, or `critical` | `normal` |
| `webhook-url` | String or `none` | `none` |
| `headers` | StringMap | `{}` |
| `payload` | JSON value or `none` | `none` |
| `email-from` | String or `none` | `none` |
| `email-to` | StringList | `[]` |
| `smtp-host` | String or `none` | `none` |
| `smtp-port` | Integer | `587` |
| `smtp-username`, `smtp-password` | String or `none` | `none` |
| `smtp-starttls` | Boolean | `true` |
| `request-timeout` | duration | `30s` |
| `retry` | HTTP retry map | attempts `1`, backoff `0s`, no retry statuses |
| `expected-statuses` | IntegerList | `[200, 201, 202, 204]` |
| `network-allowlist` | StringList | `[]` |

Slack, Teams, and generic webhook channels require `webhook-url`. Email requires
`email-from`, at least one `email-to` value, and `smtp-host`. The `with` block may replace
the message fields, destination fields, headers, payload, and SMTP connection values for
one execution. Runtime credentials do not appear in the success output.

## Composition nodes

| Type | Required fields | Optional fields and defaults |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow` | exactly one of `workflow-id: String` or `workflow-path: Path` | `version: positive Integer = none`; the common `with` block supplies public inputs. |

`workflow-id` resolves an installed workflow through the destination registry.
`workflow-path` resolves a project-relative `.rad` source file. The compiler must load the
referenced workflow's public interface to validate `with` bindings and outputs. The child
runs as an isolated workflow invocation. Its internal node outputs are private.

Legacy TOML `parameter_bindings` and `input_bindings` both migrate to `with`. A duplicate
name is a migration error. Legacy component output selectors migrate to public outputs on
the referenced workflow rather than remaining at each call site.

See [output-contracts.md](output-contracts.md) for the public workflow interface and
built-in output contract format.

## Required contract work

All built-in node tables have machine-readable contracts. Secret bindings use exact
environment names and may feed compatible HTTP and notification input ports through
`with`. Each built-in contract declares its successful output schema.
